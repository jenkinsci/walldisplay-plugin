    <p>
    Set the build range. If you have a large number of builds, showing every single passing build
    can obscure the important information of "what's broken". Therefore, you may
    wish to filter the builds that get shown using this setting.
    </p>    

    <p>For example, if you set this to "Active today", the only passing builds that will be shown will
        be builds that have been run in the last 24 hours.</p>

    <p>Failing and unstable builds will always be shown, regardless of when they
       were last run.</p>
